# Playground

General React playground for experimenting with new things.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Overview

* Generally the playground contains the latest and greatest variation in how I think of structuring a React application.
* `standardjs` linting (https://standardjs.com/)
* `styled-components` css-in-js (https://www.styled-components.com)
* Commands include `NODE_PATH` to leverage absolute pathing to `src/` for cleaner imports.
* `redux-first-router` (https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router)
* `redux-saga` (https://redux-saga.js.org/)
* `redux-actions` (https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions)
